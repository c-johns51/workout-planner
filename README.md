## Free Workout Planner ðŸ’ª  &nbsp; [![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

This is a web app that allows users to plan weekly exercise routines using a browsable catalogue. This project was forked from [free-exercise-db](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db), an open public domain exercise dataset in `JSON` format with 800+ exercises. This project offers these additional features to the database:
- User-friendly interface
- Allows users to look at a routine for the week and plan exercises for each workout day
- Allows user to keep track of the muscles theyâ€™re hitting in each workout
- Allows users to see what muscles they could still hit on a given day
- Allows users to create and add new exercises to the database

## Why
Planning effective workouts can be overwhelming due to scattered resources and limitations in existing workout management apps. Most apps fall short in key areas, such as:
- Providing comprehensive muscle targeting information for exercises
- Offering clear, step-by-step guidance for proper form
- Including a diverse range of exercise options

Our web app bridges these gaps by offering a community-driven platform with:
- A robust, searchable catalog of exercises, complete with detailed muscle targeting information
- Clear, instructional guidance to ensure proper technique

## What Makes Us Unique?
Unlike most apps, which are cluttered with unnecessary features, our app focuses exclusively on streamlined workout planning.

By prioritizing usability and intuitive design, we provide a no-frills, user-friendly experience tailored specifically to help users efficiently plan and organize their workouts.

## Remaining Work
A list of incomplete tasks we hope to implement:
- Allow users to click on an exercise from the catalogue or from their routine and be redirected to the exerciseâ€™s detail page
- Allow users to filter exercises by difficulty, type of movement (push, pull, core, etc.), and type of exercise (strength, stretch, etc.)
- Fixes to issues with some webpage elements displaying improperly on mobile
